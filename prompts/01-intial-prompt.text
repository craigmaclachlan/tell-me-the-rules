I am a board game enthusiast. I like to play with my friends. Sometimes we have questions about the rules. I'd like to build an app that we can ask rules questions and it will answer with a rules clarification. The application should be able to read rules from PDF files. Initially I just want a simple web based application. Please could you suggest the architecture for this application and the steps to building it? 

I'm most familiar with python, so prefer solution that use this.
